## Repositories
### Imperial College London (Computing with Software Engineering Specialism, MSc) - Courseworks
Courseworks as part of my Software Engineering Specialist Course at Imperial.

#### 1. [Machine Learning 1 - Decision Trees](https://github.com/mchara01/WiFi_location_prediction)
Coursework Grade: 100%  |  TECH: Python, Matplotlib, Git<br>
Decision Tree classification model, built from scratch, that predicts a user's location based on WiFi signals (continuous dataset).

#### 2. [Machine Learning 2 - Neural Network](https://github.com/alicialawjy/Housing-Price-Neural-Network)
Coursework Grade: 99% | TECH: Python, PyTorch, Numpy, Pandas, Git<br>
An artifical Neural Network regression model used to predict housing prices based on the Californian Housing Dataset.

#### 3. [Software Engineering Project - FuelOpt](https://github.com/mchara01/FuelOpt)
Coursework Grade: 83% | TECH: Python, Django, Dart, Flutter, AWS, SQL, MariaDB, Docker, Git<br>
Watch demo video here: [demo video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGsksgoK-4Q&t=576s&ab_channel=NadimRahman) <br>
A mobile application used to assist drivers in planning and optimising their fuel-filling journeys in terms of cost, time, and fuel efficiency. This was 13-week long Software Engineering Group Project where I was responsible for developing the optimisation algorithm, maintaining the backend server and our APIs.

#### 4. [Image Processing and Workflow](https://github.com/WeiSin99/scheduling-coursework)
Coursework Grade: 90% | TECH: Python, Azure<br>
Use different scheduling algorithms to assign and assess image processing workflow on Azure servers. This was done as part of the Scheduling and Resource Allocation course.

### Projects for Harvard x EdX Course ‚Äì [CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/)
A ~30-hour online course on web programming. Personal web development projects I did upon completing the course:

#### 1. [bubble](https://github.com/alicialawjy/bubble)
A twitter-like social network website. 

#### 2. [commerce](https://github.com/alicialawjy/commerce)
An eBay-like e-commerce auction site.

#### 3. [mail](https://github.com/alicialawjy/mail)
A gmail-like emailing platform.

#### 4. [wiki](https://github.com/alicialawjy/wiki)
A Wikipedia-like encyclopedia. 

### Imperial College London (Civil Engineering, MEng) - Project Scripts (MATLAB)
These repositories host scripts to major programming scripts I worked on while in university, meant for structural design applications.
#### 1. [MATLAB-roof-optimisation](https://github.com/alicialawjy/MATLAB-roof-optimisation)
The design and optimisation of an arched steel roof truss system spanning 100m done with engineering consultancy, ARUP.
#### 2. [MATLAB-sway-structure](https://github.com/alicialawjy/MATLAB-sway-structure)
The design and optimisation of sway structures using Frames vs Trusses.
