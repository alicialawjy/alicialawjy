# Imperial College London - Software Engineering Computing (MSc)
Welcome to my project list where I document all projects I've done as part of my degree at Imperial. 

## Machine Learning
### 1. [Natural Language Processing 1 - Multilingual Psychothearapy Chatbot](https://github.com/alicialawjy/multilingual-psychotherapy-chatbot)
Distinguished Project Award | Grade: 89% | TECH: Python (Pytorch, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Transformers, NLTK), Slurm, Flask, React, AWS, Git<br>
1. Developed a multilingual emotion classifier with >90% accuracy in Mandarin and English using state-of-the-art language models (XLM-R, InfoXLM),
2. Achieved a 6-fold reduction in inference latency and reduced cost of deployment through Knowledge Distillation (model compression),
3. Developed a fluent, accurate and empathetic text rewriting system using generative language model GPT-2, trained using reinforcement learning and supervised learning methods, safe for use in psychotherapeutic treatment,
4. Deployed ML models in a chatbot web application, with ~90% satisfaction ratings for engagement and usefulness in non-clinical human trials.

### 2. [Natural Language Processing 2 - Patronising Language Detection](https://github.com/alicialawjy/Patronizing-Language-Detection)
Coursework Grade: 90% | TECH: Python, Jupyter, Numpy, Pandas, HuggingFace, Git<br>
Develop a NLU language model for patronising and condescending language (PCL) detection, submitted as part of the <em>[SemEval 2022 competition task](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/34344)</em>. Work done include data analysis, cleaning and augmentation. Code utilised state-of-the-art RoBERTa model trained on the <em>[Don't Patronise Me!](https://aclanthology.org/2020.coling-main.518/)</em> dataset.

### 3. [Machine Learning 1 - Neural Network](https://github.com/alicialawjy/Housing-Price-Neural-Network)
Coursework Grade: 99% | TECH: Python, PyTorch, Numpy, Pandas, Git<br>
A deep learning Neural Network regression model, built from scratch, used to predict housing prices based on the Californian Housing Dataset.

### 4. [Machine Learning 2 - Decision Trees](https://github.com/mchara01/WiFi_location_prediction)
Coursework Grade: 100%  |  TECH: Python, Matplotlib, Git<br>
Decision Tree classification model, built from scratch, that predicts a user's location based on WiFi signals.

## Software Engineering
### 1. [Software Engineering Project - FuelOpt](https://github.com/mchara01/FuelOpt)
Coursework Grade: 83% | TECH: Python, Django, Dart, Flutter, AWS, SQL, MariaDB, Docker, Git<br>
Watch demo video here: [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGsksgoK-4Q) <br>
A mobile application used to assist drivers in planning and optimising their fuel-filling journeys in terms of cost, time, and fuel efficiency. This was 13-week long Software Engineering Group Project where I was responsible for developing the optimisation algorithm, maintaining the backend server and our APIs.

### 2. [Distributed Algorithms - Banking Raft Algorithm](https://github.com/alicialawjy/Banking-Raft-Algorithm)
Coursework Grade: 95% | TECH: Functional Programming using Elixir <br>
Implement and evaluate a simple replicated banking service using the Raft consensus algorithm.

### 3. [Blockchain - Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/alicialawjy/tic-tac-toe)
Coursework Grade: 100% | TECH: Solidity <br>
Implement a tic-tac-toe game using Solidity.

### 4. [Image Processing and Workflow](https://github.com/WeiSin99/scheduling-coursework)
Coursework Grade: 90% | TECH: Python, Azure<br>
Use different scheduling algorithms to assign and assess image processing workflow on Azure servers. This was done as part of the Scheduling and Resource Allocation course.
